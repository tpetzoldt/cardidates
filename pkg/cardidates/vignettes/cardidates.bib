  abstract = {Phenology and seasonal succession in aquatic ecosystems are strongly
  dependent on physical factors. In order to promote investigations
      into this coupling, methods of characterising annual time series
      of phytoplankton were derived and applied to a 31-year data set from
      Saidenbach Reservoir (Saxony, Germany). Field data are often scarce
      and irregularly sampled, particularly in the transition period from
      winter to spring, so reliable methods of determining cardinal dates
      in the time series are necessary. The proposed methods were used
      to determine the beginning, maximum and end of the spring mass development
      of phytoplankton by estimating the inflexion points (A), fitting
      a Weibull-type function (B) and fitting linear segments to the logarithmic
      values (C). For the data set from Saidenbach Reservoir, all three
      methods proved to be relevant to the analysis of longterm trends.
      Differences between the maxima determined by the different methods
      seemed small, but there were deviations when the maximum was related
      to physical factors such as ice-out. The Weibull-type fit gave the
      most reliable and comprehensible results and is recommended for trend
      analyses. For all methods, long-term analysis of the duration of
      the spring mass development and the duration of the spring full circulation
      revealed a period of consistently low values (1975-1990) followed
      by a period of higher values (1990-2005). These periods were also
      identified for the date of ice-out, although in this case there was
      a period of high values followed by a period of low values. A sensitivity
      analysis that compared results from subsampled time series with increasing
      time intervals indicated that a minimum of one sample every three
      weeks is needed to obtain reliable results.},
